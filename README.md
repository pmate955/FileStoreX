# File Store X

Small Ruby on Rails app for an online file encryptor with XOR coding. (This will be updated soon with better
encrypting algorythm)
There are 2 options:
 * Anonymus user can upload a file and encrypt/decrypt, and download the result, but the file will be deleted from server after download.
 * Registrated user can upload maximum 5 files to server, and send the file as link. The receiver can upload the
 file with a password
 * Extra function will be available once (Download encrypted file as PNG)
